# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Classifier-Model-for-Predicting-Employee-Churn

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
### Step-1: 
Import the required libraries.
### Step-2:
2. Load the dataset.
### Step-3:
3. Define X and Y array.
### Step-4:
4. Define a function for costFunction,cost and gradient.
### Step-5:
5. Define a function to plot the decision boundary. 6.Define a function to predict the 
   Regression value. 

## Program:
